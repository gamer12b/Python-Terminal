# Python-Terminal
This is a basic python terminal with some commands, but i'm still working on it, it has some bugs that i will have to fix later, its currently in a alpha stage.
# Windows only for now!

# How to install
1. First of all download the setup file.
2. Make sure you have python installed and open a terminal window and run "pip3 install setup.py" without the brackets
